If you are interesting in contributing to this project, feel free to contact
me. Alternatively, create a custom branch, add your contribution, then 
finally create a pull request. If I accept the pull request, I will merge 
your custom branch with the latest development branch. The latter will 
eventually be merged into a future release version.
To contribute, you need to have a solid knowledge of C++ (preferably C++11), 
including templates and the standard library, a basic knowledge of 
quantum computing and linear algebra, and working experience with 
[Eigen 3](http://eigen.tuxfamily.org).
