    - Added "examples/reversible.cpp" example
    - The path to MATLAB can now be specified in the CMake command line (not

    - qpp::ket operator "" _ket(), qpp::ket operator "" _bra() and
      qpp::ket operator "" _prj() are now inside the newly introduced inline

    - Added a getter for qpp::RandomDevices::prng_ (now with private access):
          qpp::RandomDevices::get_prng()
    - Eigen3 is detected automatically by CMake (if Eigen3 was installed via a
      package manager). If not, it can be specified manually by passing the
      -DEIGEN3_INCLUDE_DIR=path_to_eigen3 flag to the CMake command line.

Version 1.0-rc1 - Release Candidate 1, 11 November 2016
    - Slight performance improvements (lambda workers do not capture by value
      anymore)
    - API change in "classes/exception.h": now all Quantum++ exceptions have
      their own type, being derived from the base exception class

          Thanks to @davidhigh http://stackoverflow.com/a/40293333/3093378
    - Fixed bug in qpp::cor()
    - Renamed qpp::loadMATLABmatrix() and saveMATLABmatrix() to
      qpp::loadMATLAB() and qpp::saveMATLAB(), respectively. Slightly changed
      their implementation so now one can load/save any Eigen type, similarly
      to qpp::load() and qpp::save().
    - Almost full code coverage via unit testing

Version 1.0.0-beta3 - 22 October 2016
    - Added support for Travis CI continuous integration
    - Added new functions in "classes/states.h":

    - Added d = 2 overloads for all functions that take a list of dimensions
      as one of their arguments
    - Additional code sanitizing and unit testing

Version 1.0.0-beta1 - 10 October 2016
    - GoogleMock 1.7.0 is now included in the project for portable unit testing
      (see the README.md file for more details)
    - Removed the qpp::ubigint type so there is no more danger of mixing signed
      and unsigned types. All related functions now use qpp::bigint.
    - Fixed overflow bug in qpp::powm() when numbers were very large
    - qpp::isprime() is now based on the Miller-Rabin primality test
    - qpp::rand(Type a, Type b) family of functions now throw if b > a for
      integer types or when a == b for floating-point types

Version 0.8.8.2 - 3 October 2016
    - This is a bug-fix release

    - Added OpenMP support for clang >= 3.7 in CmakeLists.txt
    - Required minimum CMake version is now 3.0
    - Added more unit testing, "number_theory.h" is now fully tested
    - Split unit testing in separate files according to the tested header file

    - SFINAE for all functions that have STL-containers as parameters
    - Improved performance via removing unnecessary copy, see Issue #31,thanks
      @vasekp
    - Corrected code typo in qpp::internal::Singleton<T>, see Issue #35, thanks
      @titaschanda
    - Fixed critical bug in qpp::lcm(const std::vector<bigint>&)
    - Fixed critical bug in qpp::x2contfrac()
    - Added new functions in "number_theory.h":

      control gates with 2 or more controls. Added unit test in
      "unit_tests/testing.cpp".
    - Removed "macros.h" preprocessor debug macros header added in v0.8.4

Version 0.8.4 - 14 October 2015
    - Added "macros.h" preprocessor debug macros header, containing:
          PRINT(x)   - std::cout << (x)
          PRINTLN(x) - std::cout << (x) << std::endl
          ERROR(x)   - std::cerr << (x)
          ERRORLN(x) - std::cerr << (x) << std::endl
    - Added new functions in "operations.h":
          qpp::ip() - Generalized inner product
    - Modified qpp::measure() so that the output consists of pure states
      whenever the input is a pure state and the measurement operators are
      rank-one POVMs (technically rank-one Kraus operators). Includes basis
      measurements as a particular case.
    - Improved qpp::Timer<>, now both the duration and the clock's type can be
      specified as template parameters, defaulted to
      std::chrono::duration<double> and std::chrono::steady_clock, respectively

Version 0.8.2 - 20 May 2015
    - Added "traits.h" type traits header file with the following type traits:
          qpp::is_iterable<> - checks for iterable STL-like containers
          qpp::is_matrix_expression<> - checks for Eigen::MatrixBase<>
          expressions
          qpp::is_complex<>  - checks whether the type is std::complex<>
    - Added "statistics.h" header file containing the following new functions:

          qpp::marginalY()  - marginal distribution
          qpp::avg()        - average
          qpp::sigma()      - standard deviation
          qpp::cov()        - covariance
          qpp::cor()        - correlation
          qpp::var()        - variance
    - Added new examples in the folder "examples"

Version 0.8 - 8 May 2015
    - Added new data type aliases in "types.h"
          bigint  - Big integer, alias for long long int
          ubigint - Non-negative big integer, alias for unsigned long long int
    - Added new overloads in "random.h":
          qpp::rand() - overloads for bigint and ubigint
    - Added new functions in "number_theory.h":
          qpp::modpow() - computes a^n mod p for non-negative integers
    - Added IDisplay as an abstract base class for enforcing the override of its
      member function
          std::ostream& IDisplay::display(std::ostream&) const
      in all derived classes. This latter function performs all of the stream
      extraction operator work, and it is invoked automatically by the
          friend std::ostream& operator<<(std::ostream&, const qpp::IDisplay&)
      defined inline in qpp::IDisplay. In other words, the extraction operator
      delegates the work to the virtual display() function. Finally, all classes
      that support stream extraction (qpp::IOManipEigen, qpp::IOManipPointer,
      qpp::IOManipRange and qpp::Timer) now inherit from qpp::IDisplay.
    - Replaced std::basic_ostream<charT, traits> by std::ostream in all code, as
      using traits over-complicated the design and it was not worth it
    - Marked final all classes that are not intended to be used as base classes
    - Modified the CMakeLists.txt, which now:
        - supports only GNU gcc and LLVM/Apple clang, otherwise emits an error
          during the CMake running phase
        - adds -D_NO_THREAD_LOCAL definition for conditional compiling the
          source code without support for std::thread_local (if using e.g.
          LLVM/Apple clang with libc++, as libc++ does not yet support
          std::thread_local)
        - uses OpenMP only if the compiler is detected as GNU gcc

Version 0.7 - 22 April 2015
    - Marked all non-template functions defined in headers as "inline" and all
      singletons as "static", since otherwise including "qpp.h" in separate
      compilation units led to linker errors due to duplicated symbols

Version 0.6 - 16 April 2015
    - Reverted changes to qpp::internal::Singleton<T> (no need anymore for
      static void operator delete(void*)), but clients have to explicitly mark
      both constructor and destructor private
    - Minor cosmetic changes

Version 0.5 - 19 March 2015
    - Fixed a bug in class qpp::internal::Singleton<T> which allowed deleting
      the instance via a pointer. Now static void operator delete(void*) is
      marked private.

Version 0.4 - 8 March 2015
    - Added noexcept specification where suitable
    - Added the following exception types to the qpp::Exception::Type strong
      enumeration: NOT_QUBIT_MATRIX (replaces previous NOT_QUBIT_GATE),
      NOT_QUBIT_CVECTOR, NOT_QUBIT_RVECTOR and NOT_QUBIT_VECTOR
    - Added overloads of qpp::ptrace1(), qpp::ptrace2(), qpp::ptrace() and
      qpp::ptranspose() that allow a pure state input, as it was the case
      before with qpp::syspermute()
    - Added overloads of qpp::prod() and qpp::sum() for STL-like containers
    - Added new functions in "functions.h":
          qpp::complement()  - computes the complement of a subsystem vector
          qpp::rho2bloch()   - qubit density matrix to Bloch vector
          qpp::bloch2rho()   - Bloch vector to qubit density matrix
    - Added new functions in "instruments.h":
          qpp::measure_seq() - measures subsystems sequentially
    - Removed support for the C-style random number engine, as it is not thread
      safe. Hence, Eigen::Matrix::Random() should not be used, use instead
      qpp::rand() functions.
    - Added support for unit testing via Google Mock/Google Test, see
      "unit_tests/testing.cpp"

Version 0.3 - 15 February 2015
    - Added qpp::internal::Singleton<T>::get_thread_local_instance()

Version 0.2 - 26 January 2015
    - Minor fixes
    - Added prime-number related functions in "number_theory.h":
          qpp::factors() - prime factors of positive integer
          qpp::isprime() - primality test

Version 0.1 - 21 December 2014
    - First stable version, initial public release
