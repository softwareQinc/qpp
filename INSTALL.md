# Installation instructions

**Quantum++** is a header-only library that uses [CMake](https://cmake.org/) as
its build/install system. **Quantum++** is platform-independent,
supporting [UNIX](https://www.opengroup.org/membership/forums/platform/unix)
(including
[macOS](https://www.apple.com/macos/)) and UNIX-like operating systems
(e.g., [Linux](https://www.linux.org)), as well
as [Windows](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/windows).

---

## Pre-requisites

- C++17 compliant compiler, e.g., [gcc](https://gcc.gnu.org/)
  , [clang](https://clang.llvm.org)
  , [MSVC](https://visualstudio.microsoft.com/vs/) etc.
- [CMake](https://cmake.org/)
- [Eigen 3](https://eigen.tuxfamily.org) linear algebra library. If missing, it
  will be installed automatically by CMake as a build dependency.

### Optional

- [Python 3](https://www.python.org/) for building and running the **pyqpp**
  Python 3 wrapper
- [MATLAB](https://www.mathworks.com/products/matlab/) compiler shared
  libraries and include header files, in case you want to enable
  interoperability with MATLAB. If enabled, allows applications build with
  **Quantum++** to save/load **Quantum++** matrices and vectors to/from MATLAB.
  The locations of the MATLAB compiler shared libraries and header files are
  platform-specific, e.g., under Linux, they may be located under
  `/usr/local/MATLAB/R2021a/bin/glnxa64` and
  `/usr/local/MATLAB/R2021a/extern/include`, respectively. On your platform the
  locations may of course differ.

---

## Configuring the system

First configure the system via CMake to use an out-of-source build directory
(e.g., `./build`) by executing (in a terminal/console/command prompt) under the
project's root directory

```shell
cmake -B build
```

---

## Building the examples and/or unit tests

To build the
[examples](https://github.com/softwareQinc/qpp/tree/main/examples), execute

```shell
cmake --build build --target=examples --parallel 8
```

The above command builds all examples as executables in `./build`. The
`--parallel 8` flag instructs CMake to build in parallel using 8 threads,
modify accordingly.

To build the
[unit tests](https://github.com/softwareQinc/qpp/tree/main/unit_tests), execute

```shell
cmake --build build/unit_tests --target unit_tests --parallel 8
```

Tu run the unit tests, execute

```shell
ctest --test-dir build
```

To build **only** a specific target, execute, e.g.,

```shell
cmake --build build --target=bb84
```

The command above builds only the example
[examples/bb84](https://github.com/softwareQinc/qpp/tree/main/examples/bb84)
and outputs the executable `./build/bb84[.exe]`.

## CMake optional arguments and flags

Note that all CMake flags below that start with `QPP_` and `QASMTOOLS_`
propagate to subprojects that use **Quantum++** in
their corresponding `CMakeLists.txt` via `findpackage(qpp ...)`.

If `QPP_MATLAB=ON` and the system could not detect your MATLAB installation,
you can manually specify the path to MATLAB's installation directory via the
additional CMake argument

    MATLAB_INSTALL_DIR=/path/to/MATLAB

If you are still receiving errors, you can manually specify the path to
MATLAB's required libraries and header files via the additional arguments

    MATLAB_LIB_DIR=/path/to/MATLAB/libs
    MATLAB_INCLUDE_DIR=/path/to/MATLAB/headers

## Installing Quantum++

### UNIX/UNIX-like/Windows

To install **Quantum++** (after
[Configuring the system](#configuring-the-system)), execute in a
terminal/console (UNIX/UNIX-like systems)

```shell
sudo cmake --build build --target install
```

or in an Administrator Command Prompt (Windows)

```shell
cmake --build build --target install
```

The above commands install **Quantum++** in `/usr/local/include/qpp` on
UNIX/UNIX-like platforms, and in `C:\Program Files (x86)\qpp` on Windows
platforms.

To uninstall, execute in a terminal/console (UNIX/UNIX-like systems)

```shell
sudo cmake --build build --target uninstall
```

or in an Administrator Command Prompt (Windows)

```shell
cmake --build build --target uninstall
```

### FreeBSD

We are proud to be part of the [FreeBSD](https://www.freebsd.org/) operating
system as an official package. If you are running FreeBSD, you can install
**Quantum++** with

```shell
sudo pkg install quantum++
```

and uninstall it with

```shell
sudo pkg remove quantum++
```

### macOS/Linux

If you are running macOS or Linux, you can install **Quantum++** via
[Homebrew](https://brew.sh) with

```shell
brew install quantum++
```

and uninstall it with

```shell
brew uninstall quantum++
```

---

## Building and running a standalone application that uses Quantum++

Below is a minimal `CMakeLists.txt` of a standalone application that uses
**Quantum++**. For simplicity, we assume that the whole application is located
in a single file `src/main.cpp`, and the `CMakeLists.txt` is located in the
project's root directory.

```cmake
cmake_minimum_required(VERSION 3.15)
project(standalone)
set(CMAKE_CXX_STANDARD 17)

# If the Quantum++ installation path was non-standard, i.e., specified by
#
# cmake -B build -DCMAKE_INSTALL_PREFIX=/path/to/installed/qpp
#
# then uncomment the following line and replace the installation path with yours

# set(CMAKE_PREFIX_PATH "/path/to/installed/qpp")

find_package(qpp REQUIRED)
add_executable(standalone src/main.cpp)
target_link_libraries(standalone PUBLIC ${QPP_LINK_DEPS} libqpp)

```

**Do not forget to ALWAYS add `${QPP_LINK_DEPS}` (verbatim)
to `target_link_libraries()`!** (last line of the
`CMakeLists.txt` file above).

Configure the application in an out-of-source directory by executing

```shell
cmake -B build
```

followed by building the application with

```shell
cmake --build build
```

The commands above builds the `standalone` executable inside the `build`
directory.

---

## Building and running a standalone application that uses Quantum++ without a build system

**Quantum++** is a header-only library. Hence, you can technically build an
application that uses **Quantum++** without using a building system, by simply
using the compiler and specifying the location to all required dependencies,
like below (assumes UNIX/UNIX-like, adapt accordingly for Windows)

```shell
g++ -pedantic -std=c++17 -Wall -Wextra -Weffc++ -fopenmp \
    -O3 -DNDEBUG -DEIGEN_NO_DEBUG
    -isystem $HOME/eigen3 -I $HOME/qpp/include -I $HOME/qpp/qasmtools/include \
     src/main.cpp -o my_qpp_app
```

If you intend to go via this route, we assume that you are familiar with how
compilers work, so we won't add any more explanations to what the line above
does.

## Additional platform-specific instructions

### macOS/OS X specific instructions

- We highly recommend installing [clang](https://clang.llvm.org/)
  via [Homebrew](https://brew.sh/), since the native AppleClang does not offer
  OpenMP support.
- In case you get any compiler or linker errors when OpenMP is enabled, you
  need to install the `libomp` package, e.g., execute

```shell
brew install libomp
```

### MATLAB support under Windows

If building under Windows
with [MATLAB](https://www.mathworks.com/products/matlab/) support, please add
the
location of
`libmx.dll` and `libmat.dll` (the `.dll` **and not** the `.lib` files) to
your `PATH` environment variable. In our case they are located
under `C:\Program Files\MATLAB\R2021a\bin\win64`.

---

## Python 3 wrapper

[**pyqpp**](https://github.com/softwareQinc/qpp/blob/main/pyqpp) is a Python 3
wrapper for **Quantum++**. **pyqpp** requires the same dependencies as
**Quantum++**, and can be installed using `pip`

```shell
pip install git+https://github.com/softwareQinc/qpp
```

For more details, please see
[pyqpp/README.md](https://github.com/softwareQinc/qpp/blob/main/pyqpp/README.md).

---

## Platform-dependent issues

### SunOS/OpenIndiana

The Python3 wrapper
[**pyqpp**](https://github.com/softwareQinc/qpp/blob/main/pyqpp) doesn't
compile under SunOS/OpenIndiana due to errors in `<cmath>` such as

```
no member named 'llround' in the global namespace; did you mean 'lround'?
```
