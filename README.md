Quantum++ is a modern C++11 general purpose quantum computing library, composed 
solely of template header files. Quantum++ is written in standard C++11 and 
has very low external dependencies, using only the 
[Eigen 3](http://eigen.tuxfamily.org) linear algebra header-only template 
library and, if available, the [OpenMP](http://openmp.org/) multi-processing 
library. 

Quantum++ is not restricted to qubit systems or specific quantum 
information processing tasks, being capable of simulating arbitrary quantum 
processes. The main design factors taken in consideration were the ease of 
use, high portability, and high performance. The library's simulation
capabilities are only restricted by the amount of available physical memory. 
On a typical machine (Intel i5 8Gb RAM) Quantum++ can successfully simulate 
the evolution of 25 qubits in a pure state or of 12 qubits in a mixed state 
reasonably fast.

## Building instructions for POSIX-compliant platforms

### Configuration

- Compiler: [g++](https://gcc.gnu.org/) version 4.8.2 or later 
(for good C++11 support)
- [Eigen 3](http://eigen.tuxfamily.org) linear algebra library. I assume here that 
the library is installed in `$HOME/eigen`, although the location may vary, e.g. if 
the libary was installed using a package manager.
- Quantum++ library located in `$HOME/qpp`

##### Optional

- [CMake](http://www.cmake.org/) version 3.0 or later, highly recommended
- [MATLAB](http://www.mathworks.com/products/matlab/) compiler include header 
files:
`/Applications/MATLAB_R2016a.app/extern/include`
- [MATLAB](http://www.mathworks.com/products/matlab/) compiler shared library 
files:
`/Applications/MATLAB_R2016a.app/bin/maci64`

### Building using [CMake](http://www.cmake.org/) (version 3.0 or later)

The current version of the repository has a `./CMakeLists.txt` configuration 
file for building examples using [CMake](http://www.cmake.org/). 
To build an example using [CMake](http://www.cmake.org/), 
I recommend an out-of-source build, i.e., from the root of the project 
(where `./include` is located), type

    mkdir ./build
    cd ./build
    cmake ..
    make

The commands above build the release version (default) executable `qpp`, 
from the source file `./examples/minimal.cpp`,
without [MATLAB](http://www.mathworks.com/products/matlab/) support (default), 
inside the directory `./build`. 

If the location of [Eigen 3](http://eigen.tuxfamily.org) is not detected
automatically by the [CMake](http://www.cmake.org/) build script, 
then the build script will fail (with an error message). In this case 
the location of [Eigen 3](http://eigen.tuxfamily.org) needs to be specified
manually in the [CMake](http://www.cmake.org/) build command line by passing
the `-DEIGEN3_INCLUDE_DIR=path_to_eigen3` flag, e.g.

    cmake .. -DEIGEN3_INCLUDE_DIR=/usr/local/eigen3

To build a different configuration, 
e.g. the debug version with [MATLAB](http://www.mathworks.com/products/matlab/)
support, type from the root of the project

    cd ./build
    rm -rf *
    cmake -DCMAKE_BUILD_TYPE=Debug -DWITH_MATLAB=ON ..
    make
    
Or, to disable [OpenMP](http://openmp.org/) support (enabled by default), type
   
    cd ./build
    rm -rf *
    cmake -DWITH_OPENMP=OFF ..
    make

To change the name of the example file or the location of 
[MATLAB](http://www.mathworks.com/products/matlab/) installation, 
edit the `./CMakeLists.txt` file. Inspect also `./CMakeLists.txt` 
for additional fine-tuning options. Do not forget to clean the `./build` 
directory before a fresh build!

### Building without an automatic build system

- Example file: `$HOME/qpp/examples/minimal.cpp`
- Output executable: `$HOME/qpp/examples/minimal`
- You must run the commands below from inside the directory 
`$HOME/qpp/examples` 

#### Release version (without [MATLAB](http://www.mathworks.com/products/matlab/) support) 

	g++ -pedantic -std=c++11 -Wall -Wextra -Weffc++ -fopenmp \
         -O3 -DNDEBUG -DEIGEN_NO_DEBUG \
         -isystem $HOME/eigen -I $HOME/qpp/include \
         minimal.cpp -o minimal

#### Debug version (without [MATLAB](http://www.mathworks.com/products/matlab/) support)

	g++ -pedantic -std=c++11 -Wall -Wextra -Weffc++ -fopenmp \
         -g3 -DDEBUG \
         -isystem $HOME/eigen -I $HOME/qpp/include \
          minimal.cpp -o minimal

#### Release version (with [MATLAB](http://www.mathworks.com/products/matlab/) support)

	g++ -pedantic -std=c++11 -Wall -Wextra -Weffc++ -fopenmp \
         -O3 -DNDEBUG -DEIGEN_NO_DEBUG \
         -isystem $HOME/eigen -I $HOME/qpp/include \
         -I/Applications/MATLAB_R2016a.app/extern/include \
         -L/Applications/MATLAB_R2016a.app/bin/maci64 \
         -lmx -lmat minimal.cpp -o minimal

#### Debug version (with [MATLAB](http://www.mathworks.com/products/matlab/) support)

	g++ -pedantic -std=c++11 -Wall -Wextra -Weffc++ -fopenmp \
         -g3 -DDEBUG \
         -isystem $HOME/eigen -I $HOME/qpp/include \
         -I /Applications/MATLAB_R2016a.app/extern/include \
         -L /Applications/MATLAB_R2016a.app/bin/maci64 \
         -lmx -lmat minimal.cpp -o minimal


## Additional building instructions for particular platforms

### [Windows](http://windows.microsoft.com/) via [Cygwin](https://www.cygwin.com)

- Some earlier versions of 
[Cygwin](https://www.cygwin.com) had a bug related to lack of support for some 
C++11 math functions, see
<http://stackoverflow.com/questions/28997206/cygwin-support-for-c11-in-g4-9-2>
for more details. Quick fix: patch the standard library header file `<cmath>` 
using the provided patch `./cmath_cygwin.patch`. Latest 
[Cygwin](https://www.cygwin.com) (as of Nov. 11, 2016) seem to have fixed
the issue.

### [Windows](http://windows.microsoft.com/) via [Visual Studio](https://www.visualstudio.com)

-  [Visual Studio](https://www.visualstudio.com) versions preceeding 
version 2015 do not have full C++11 support. If you decide to use 
[Visual Studio](https://www.visualstudio.com) make sure you install version
2015 or later. 
    
- [Visual Studio 2015](https://www.visualstudio.com) only
supports [OpenMP 2.0](http://openmp.org/). Quantum++ uses features
from [OpenMP 3.0](http://openmp.org/), hence Quantum++ will not compile
on [Visual Studio 2015](https://www.visualstudio.com) if you enable 
[OpenMP](http://openmp.org/) (disabled by default) in
    
    *Project/Properties/Configuration Properties/C_C++/Language/Open MP Support*
    
and `#define WITH_OPENMP_` in your source file.

- To create a [Visual Studio 2015](https://www.visualstudio.com) or later 
console solution, start by creating a *Win32 Console Application*

    *File/New/Project.../Installed/Templates/Visual C++/Win32/Win32 Console Application*

    Click *Next* then select *Console Application* as *Application Type*. 
    Click *Finish* to create the solution. Next select 

    *Project/Properties* 

    from the main menu. The *Property Pages* configuration window will open.
    From the latter select *All configurations* from the top left 
    *Configuration* drop box. Next select

    *Configuration Properties/C_C++/General*

    and add to the field *Additional Include Directories* the location of 
    Quantum++ `./include` folder as well as the location of 
    [Eigen 3](http://eigen.tuxfamily.org). It should look similar to 

    **C:\Users\User\Downloads\eigen;C:\Users\User\Downloads\qpp\include;%(AdditionalIncludeDirectories)**

    Finally select 

    *Configuration Properties/C_C++/Advanced*

    and add to the field *Disable Specific Warnings* the values **4503;4996**. 
    Click *Ok* to save the settings and close the *Property Pages* window. 
    You are now ready to go.

### [OS X/macOS](http://www.apple.com/osx)

- If you want to compile with [clang++](http://clang.llvm.org/) version 3.7 or
later, I highly recommend to install it via [
macports](https://www.macports.org/). 

- If you run the program with 
[MATLAB](http://www.mathworks.com/products/matlab/) support, make sure that 
the environment variable `DYLD_LIBRARY_PATH` is set to point to the 
[MATLAB](http://www.mathworks.com/products/matlab/) 
compiler library location, see the `run_mac_MATLAB` script. 
Otherwise, you get a runtime error similar to  

    > dyld: Library not loaded: @rpath/libmat.dylib.
    
   * I recommend running via a script, as otherwise setting the 
    `DYLD_LIBRARY_PATH` globally may interfere with 
    [macports](https://www.macports.org/)' [CMake](http://www.cmake.org/) 
    installation (in case you use [CMake](http://www.cmake.org/) from 
    [macports](https://www.macports.org/)). If you use a script, 
    then the environment variable is local to the script and 
    does not interfere with the rest of the system.

   * Example of script, assumed to be located in the root directory 
    of Quantum++
        
            #!/bin/sh
            
            MATLAB=/Applications/MATLAB_R2016a.app
            export DYLD_LIBRARY_PATH=$DYLD_LIBRARY_PATH:$MATLAB/bin/maci64
            
            ./build/qpp

- If you build a debug version with [g++](https://gcc.gnu.org/) and use 
[gdb](http://www.gnu.org/software/gdb/) to step inside template functions 
you may want to add `-fno-weak` compiler flag. See 
<http://stackoverflow.com/questions/23330641/gnu-gdb-can-not-step-into-template-functions-os-x-mavericks>
for more details about this problem.


## Unit testing

Quantum++ was extensively tested under multiple flavours of Linux,
[OS X/macOS](http://www.apple.com/osx), 
[Windows XP/7/10](http://windows.microsoft.com/),
[Solaris 11.x](https://www.oracle.com/solaris/solaris11/index.html)
via a suite of unit tests constructed with
[Google Test 1.8.0](https://github.com/google/googletest) (included with the 
project in `./unit_tests/lib/gtest-1.8.0`). The source code of the unit tests 
is provided under `./unit_tests/tests`. To build and run the unit tests, I 
strongly recommend to use [CMake](http://www.cmake.org/) version 3.0 or 
later. Assuming you do use [CMake](http://www.cmake.org/), switch to the  
`./unit_tests` directory, create a `build` directory inside it, then from the 
newly created `./unit_tests/build` type

    cmake ..
    make
    
The commands above build `./unit_tests/build/tests/qpp_testing`, which you 
then may run. Note that `qpp::Timer` tests or tests related to random functions
such as `qpp::rand()` may sometime (very rarely) fail, due to timing 
imprecision or statistical errors. Such behaviour is perfectly normal.

#### Note

The [CMake](http://www.cmake.org/) configuration file 
`./unit_tests/CMakeLists.txt` defines the same building options and default 
choices as the main `./CMakeLists.txt` of Quantum++.  Therefore you can use the 
same flags as the ones mentioned at the beginning of this document when 
customizing the build. You should modify `./unit_tests/CMakeLists.txt` 
accordingly in case your [Eigen 3](http://eigen.tuxfamily.org) library or 
[MATLAB](http://www.mathworks.com/products/matlab/) include/library files are 
in a different location than the one assumed in this document.


## Additional remarks

- If you use [clang++](http://clang.llvm.org/) version 3.7 or later and want 
to use [OpenMP](http://openmp.org/) (enabled by default), make sure to modify 
`CLANG_LIBOMP` and `CLANG_LIBOMP_INCLUDE` in `CMakeLists.txt` so they point to 
the correct location of the [OpenMP](http://openmp.org/) library, as otherwise 
[clang++](http://clang.llvm.org/) will not find `<omp.h>` and the `libomp` 
shared library.
