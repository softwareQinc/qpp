## About

Quantum++ is a modern C++ general purpose quantum computing library, composed solely of template header files. Quantum++
is written in standard C++17 and has very low external dependencies, using only
the [Eigen 3](http://eigen.tuxfamily.org) linear algebra header-only template library and, if available,
the [OpenMP](http://openmp.org/) multi-processing library.

Quantum++ is not restricted to qubit systems or specific quantum information processing tasks, being capable of
simulating arbitrary quantum processes. The main design factors taken in consideration were the ease of use, high
portability, and high performance. The library's simulation capabilities are only restricted by the amount of available
physical memory. On a typical machine (Intel i5 8Gb RAM) Quantum++ can successfully simulate the evolution of 25 qubits
in a pure state or of 12 qubits in a mixed state reasonably fast.

To report any bugs or ask for additional features/enhancements, please
[submit an issue](https://github.com/softwareQinc/qpp/issues) with an appropriate label.

If you are interested in contributing to this project, feel free to contact us. Alternatively, fork the repository,
create a custom branch, add your contribution, then finally create a pull request. If we accept the pull request, we
will merge your custom branch with the latest main/development branch. The latter will eventually be merged into a
future release version. To contribute, it is preferable to have a solid knowledge of modern C++ (preferably C++17 or
later), including templates and the standard library, a basic knowledge of quantum computing and linear algebra, and
working experience with [Eigen 3](http://eigen.tuxfamily.org).

For additional [Eigen 3](http://eigen.tuxfamily.org) documentation see <http://eigen.tuxfamily.org/dox/>. For a simple
[Eigen 3](http://eigen.tuxfamily.org) quick ASCII reference see

## Installation instructions and further documentation

Please see the installation guide
[`INSTALL.md`](https://github.com/softwareQinc/qpp/blob/main/INSTALL.md) and the
comprehensive [Wiki](https://github.com/softwareQinc/qpp/wiki) for further documentation and detailed examples.

To generate the full official API documentation in both LaTeX and HTML formats run
[`doxygen`](http://www.doxygen.nl) on the [`Doxyfile`](https://github.com/softwareQinc/qpp/blob/main/Doxyfile) file. The
tool `dot` from the [`Graphviz`](https://www.graphviz.org) package must be installed (`sudo apt-get install graphviz` on
Ubuntu/Debian Linux, or `brew install graphviz` on macOS). Running `doxygen` will generate the documentation
directory `doc` containing both the HTML and LaTeX documentation.

The HTML documentation file will be accessible by opening `doc/html/index.html` with the browser of your choice. To
generate a PDF file of the documentation, run

```bash
latexmk -pdf refman.tex
```

from the `doc/latex` directory or compile the file `doc/latex/refman.tex` with your LaTeX compiler. This will create
the `doc/latex/refman.pdf` documentation file. Consult your favourite LaTeX manual for how to compile/build LaTeX files
under your specific operating system.
